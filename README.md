#  50 Days of Python, Data Science, and Machine Learning Coding Challenge ðŸŽ‰

Welcome to my **50 Days of Code** challenge! Over the next 50 days, I will be focusing on improving my skills in **Python**, **Data Science**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**. Follow along as I solve problems, build projects, and share insights!

## ðŸŽ¯ Challenge Goals
- Revisit Python basics and work through advanced concepts
- Apply my knowledge to real-world problems in Data Science and Machine Learning
- Build small projects to demonstrate learning
